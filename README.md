# PokeAPI-Discord-Bot

A C# Discord bot that fetches Pok√©mon info and plays a guess-the-Pok√©mon game using PokeAPI.

## Commands

üîç `!pokemon [name/blank]`  
Shows information about a specific Pok√©mon by name or fetches a random Pok√©mon's details if you use `!pokemon`.

‚ùì `!guess`  
Starts a guessing game where the bot displays a hidden Pok√©mon's image, and you have 10 seconds to guess which Pok√©mon it is!

## How it works

This bot uses the [PokemonApiWrapper](https://github.com/CinnamonYeti459/PokemonApiWrapper) library to interact with the official PokeAPI, retrieving Pok√©mon data such as stats, sprites, and more.


## Getting Started

- Download the repo
- Download DSharpPlus, DSharpPlus.CommandsNext, DSharpPlus.Interactivity, Newtonsoft.Json and my API wrapper for PokeAPI on my GitHub
- Edit the config.json to include your own bot token
- Invit the bot to your server and have fun


## Coming Soon
- More detailed Pok√©mon information, including abilities, various sprites (like shiny versions), and additional features.
